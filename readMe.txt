Hi, welcome to the readMe.txt for Programming Project 1

Notes: For the Average.java file, it is a renamed copy of the original Average.java file we were given to work on. I wanted to test 
some functionality on a seperate copy file and that file eventually became the main submissions file. However, all the code is mine and everything there
was worked in Codio. Just wanted to give a heads up.
